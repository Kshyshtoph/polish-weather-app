This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project - editing steps are described in the docs.

## Polish weather app

This project uses openMeteo [API](https://open-meteo.com/) to fetch current weathrer along with data from past 2 days and forecast for 3 upcomming days for 8 biggest polish cities.

Styling is done using Tailwind.css ([docs](https://tailwindui.com/documentation))

I use React google charts package ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-charts)) to display the data from API

I am using weather symbols available at forcea ([here](https://developer.foreca.com/resources))

You can preview the project deployed at [vercel](https://polish-weather-app.vercel.app/)
